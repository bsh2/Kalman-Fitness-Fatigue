The first column shows the training effort (0 means no training)

The second column shows the performance (0 means not measured)

Units are as described in the paper "Performance Estimation using the Fitness-Fatigue Model with Kalman Filter Feedback", International Journal of Computer Science in Sport, Volume 16, Issue 2 
cf. Section "Experimental Setup", page 122.
